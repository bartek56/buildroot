Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

Tested on Debian GNU/Linux 9 (Stretch) 4.9.210-1 (2020-01-20) x86_64 GNU/Linux

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make'
2) wait while it compiles
3) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
